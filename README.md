## 🚀 Overview

**SalesEZ** is a free, local-first Chrome extension that extracts and scrubs **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** leads directly into **Google Sheets** or **CSV** in a single click.

Built for **founders, SDRs, B2B marketers, and recruiters**, SalesEZ eliminates the need for expensive cloud scrapers ($49–$99/mo) and manual copy-pasting. Run any people search on LinkedIn Sales Navigator, set your target lead count, and let SalesEZ automatically paginate and scrub your lead list **100% locally inside your browser**—zero external servers, zero tracking.

| | • Smart Title Case: converts ALL-CAPS names to clean Title Case while **preserving professional acronyms** (`CEO`, `CTO`, `VP`, `MBA`, `PhD`, `CPA`, etc.) |
| | • Strips legal suffixes from company names (`Inc.`, `LLC`, `Ltd.`, `GmbH`, `Corp.`, `Pvt. Ltd.`) for natural cold-email personalization |
